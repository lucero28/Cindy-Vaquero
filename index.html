<p> I like helping out/volunteering in the community. Which shows that I care for others. </p>
<p> I am an organizer. I love to plan thing out ahead of time. </p>
<p>I am Conventional. Which means that I like to follow procedures & routines. </p>
<p> I am Realistic. I love to do hands on work with the environment, tools, and with real-word materials.</p>
<p> I am also an active person. I used to practice basketball when I was a child growing up.
  I did karate and other martial arts for about 3years.A year later I did ballet.Then I did soccer.
  Time to time, I draw or do crochet when I am bored. I like to stay active and try out new things. </p>
<p> I want to be an architect or a person who helps children in some sort of way.</p>
